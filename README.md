# P2P Lending Marketplace

To cope up with the financial disruptions, bank itself will provide a P2P lending market place where investor can meet borrower directly. A link for P2P market place will be provided on banks home page. Basically, bank itself will provide a P2P lending facility in its own environment but the policies will be same as a third party lending website.
Bank will not take the responsibility of any risks that P2P lending possesses. 

The idea of having P2P lending market place by bank itself will give users a sense of security than other funding sites. As bank has got all the history of a person who is already a member itself, it will be easy for them to facilitate the users with the best possible option. For example, suppose a borrower has the history of not returning in the due time, the bank can always put a red flag to the user and the lending option for him will not be the same as others.

Same goes with Investor. Bank will show the promising lenders who have a good history of returning the amount in due or before time. 

For the security risks checks as bank have the access of userâ€™s history, the investors will be provided with a facility of checking the risk factor against a borrower. They can check there external ratings and risk score. 

A user will be provided the facility to login as a register or as a borrower or via his/her Google account.
